    | Page styles
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | When enabled, `@bladewindStyles` links a root stylesheet plus a per-page
    | stylesheet holding only the utilities the page can use, generated on the
    | first request that needs it and cached by content under `assets.path`.
    | `max_files` caps the number of page stylesheets kept per compiled
    | stylesheet (oldest pruned first). Pages fall back to the full stylesheet
    | whenever their class set cannot be established.
    |
    | delivery decides how the page's own CSS reaches the browser. "link" (the
    | default) links the generated page stylesheet, so the browser caches it per
    | URL. "inline" writes it into the HTML as a <style> element instead. That
    | saves a request on a cold visit and removes the wire:navigate flash
    | (Livewire does not wait for a newly appended stylesheet link, so a page
    | needing new utilities can render one frame without them). The cost is that
    | the page CSS (a kilobyte or two) travels with every HTML response. The root
    | stylesheet stays a link either way. Under a Content Security Policy,
    | register the nonce with Vite::useCspNonce() and every generated tag carries
    | it; without one, a policy that forbids inline styles blocks the <style>
    | element, so keep "link".
    |
    | unanalysed decides what happens when a rendered view has no analysis entry
    | because it sits outside `paths` (a package's own Blade views). Its `@else`
    | branches and runtime classes are unknown, so "fallback" (the default) serves
    | that page the full stylesheet and logs BW6003 naming the view: add its
    | directory to `paths` to get page styles back. "html" builds the page from
    | the classes that rendered, which is right until the first Livewire update
    | reveals a branch the analysis never saw.
    |
    | keep_variables names theme variables that JavaScript reads by name, which
    | the server cannot see (getPropertyValue('--color-brand'), a chart library
    | fed from a CSS custom property). Each one is defined on every page whether
    | or not its CSS or markup mentions it. Entries are exact names
    | ('--color-brand') or a prefix pattern ('--color-brand-*').
